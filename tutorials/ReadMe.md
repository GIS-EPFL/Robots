## Robot Model Technical Specifications

### Axis Alignment and Default Orientation of the Robot

When robots axes are aligned, meaning all angles are set to zero the robot looks like the image below. Moving to this position might be needed when the batteries of the robot are out-of charge. (To-Do: write a procedure of teach-pendant what has to be done to reset the memory of the robot when the batteries are out of charge )

### Heights of the Ground | Rail | Pedestal |

The top of the pedestal is the robot Origin: **0.00 mm**

The top mounting plate of the rail is the pedestal Origin: **-250 mm**

The floor, even if it is not completely flat Origin: **-700 mm**

### Movements: Linear | Axis | Tool

For jogging go to the following menu:

Movement can be of a track or robot, to switch between the two follow the process below:

There are two white buttons in the middle right of the teach:
a) the first one allows to change the robot movement between a tool and cartesian linear axis movements
b) and the one below allows to move the robot axis by axis.
