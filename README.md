# Robots in GIS

## To-do for the next time

- [ ] update urdf so that it is not in the middle, move urdf by the translation value
- [ ] find an object that represents a plane, move robot to that position, get the position in code, move robot out of tha position, then from code move the robot to the measured target, check if the result is the same
- [ ] linear movements
- [ ] move rail while keeping the end effector at the same position
- [ ] ios of robot
- [ ] write a wish-list what to ask to Philippe
- [ ] custom tool tutorial for the robot studio

## Playground
- [ ] attach tool
- [ ] send multiple planes, by converting the grashopper to python code
