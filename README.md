This process is already finished on all GIS-robots. If you need to do so please follow the documentation by Isla Xi Han (WIP Jingwen will put it somewhere)

### 2. Software Installation
- [X] [Software Installation](https://github.com/GIS-EPFL/Robots/blob/main/SoftwareInstallation.md) (by IBOIS)


### 3. Obtain Licenses

- [ ] (Optional) RobotStudio licenses 


## II. How to use this repo | How to calibrate robots

- [ ] [Use of the repo and calibration](https://github.com/GIS-EPFL/Robots/blob/main/robot_files/ReadMe.md) (WIP by Jingwen Marirena Alex Joseph )
