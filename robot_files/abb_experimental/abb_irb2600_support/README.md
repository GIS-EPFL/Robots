# ABB IRB2600 Support Package

## Supported Variants

This package currently supports the 165cm (short arm) reach variants of the
ABB IRB2600 including both the 12kg and 20kg payloads. From a ROS-I perspective,
there is no difference between the robots with different payloads so they are
both supported under the `irb2600_12_165` name.
