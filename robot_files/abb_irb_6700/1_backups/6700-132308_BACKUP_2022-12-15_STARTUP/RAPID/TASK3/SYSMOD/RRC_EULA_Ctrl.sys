    ! IF YOU INTEND TO USE THE SOFTWARE FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES (e.g. COMMERCIAL) PLEASE CONTACT: rrc@arch.ethz.ch
    ! This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you ("You") (either an individual or a person
    ! acting on behalf of a legal entity) and ETH Zurich, Raemistrasse 101, 8092 Zurich (Switzerland) ("ETH Zurich") for
    ! the "Rapid Robot Communication Server for ABB Robots" which includes computer software and associated media, and may
    ! include "online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE"). The SOFTWARE enables the dynamic communication of a robot
    ! system. Dynamic communication means that changing contents can be transferred into production commands without the

    ! from previous production commands in order to adapt the current product (e.g. to react to process tolerances). The
    ! SOFTWARE is installed on the robot control and any client with the appropriate interface (e.g. COMPAS_RRC) can connect
    ! to this server. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws. The SOFTWARE is hereby licensed, not sold. In order to 
    ! use the SOFTWARE, You must indicate agreement with the following terms and conditions by signing this EULA. If You are
